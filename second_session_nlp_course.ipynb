    "We have seen the traditional approach to NLP, but after the resurgence of neural networks, those become the state-of-the-art methods for NLP. In this session, we will see how to use neural networks for NLP tasks. We will start with the basics of neural networks and then move on to the advanced concepts. We will also see how to use pre-trained models for NLP tasks. We will use PyTorch for this session. \n",

    "## What is a neural network? üß†\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a set of algorithms that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated. When created they were inspired by the way that biological nervous systems such as the brain process information, although today the architectures don't resemble biological neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name implies, a neural network is a set of neurons which are connected to each other. \n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Perceptron üèãÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron is the building block of a neural network. It is a single neuron that takes in a set of inputs, performs some calculations, and outputs a value.\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=https://images.deepai.org/glossary-terms/perceptron-6168423.jpg height=200>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron true power comes from the activation function, which allows it to learn non-linear relationships between the inputs and outputs. Without it the perceptron is just a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activation Functions üåã\n",
    "After we perform the weighted sum of the inputs and the weights, we need to pass the result through an activation function. The activation function changes the output of the perceptron based on the input. There are several different activation functions, depending on the problem we are trying to solve. Here are some of the most common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sigmoid\n",
    "- Tanh\n",
    "- ReLU\n",
    "- Leaky ReLU\n",
    "- Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loss functions üìâ\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a neural network is to find the best set of weights that will minimize the loss function. The loss function is a measure of how far off the neural network is from the true values. The loss function is also known as the cost function or the error function. There are several different loss functions, depending on the problem we are trying to solve. Here are some of the most common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error\n",
    "- Binary Cross Entropy\n",
    "- Categorical Cross Entropy\n",

    "\n",
    "# Optimizers üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer is the algorithm that will update the weights of the neural network. The optimizer is what makes the neural network learn. There are several different optimizers, depending on the problem we are trying to solve. Here are some of the most common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "- Adam\n",
    "- RMSProp\n",

    "## Embeddings\n",
    "As we can see the performance is pretty bad, even though we are using neural networks. This is because we are not optimizing our representations. We are just using vectors with the size of the vocabulary. We can do better than that. We can use embeddings. Embeddings are a way to represent words in a vector space. The idea is that words that are similar will be close to each other in the vector space. We can use pre-trained embeddings or we can train our own embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal latent space (vector space) is where semantically similar words are close together. For example, the words \"car\" and \"automobile\" are similar, so they should be close together in the vector space. The same goes for \"bike\" and \"bicycle\". The words \"car\" and \"bicycle\" are not similar, so they should be far apart in the vector space.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The two most common ways to create word embeddings are:\n",
    "- **Word2Vec** (Mikolov et al., 2013)\n",
    "- **GloVe** (Pennington et al., 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Should I train my own embedder model? ü§î\n",
    "It depends, most of the time is not worth it. If you have tons of data and enough computational power, then you can train your own model. Otherwise, you can use a pre-trained model. And if you have a very specific domain, you can do **fine-tuning**. Which means, taking advantage of the features the pre-trained representations have learned and then adjust the model to your domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where do I get the pretrained models? ü§ó\n",
    "There are many places you can find the pretrained models, but the most popular one is [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). They have a lot of models for different tasks and different languages. You can also find the models in the [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/).\n",

    "## Transformers ü§ñ\n",
    "Up to 2017, the word2vec and Glove approaches were the state-of-the-art, but that year a groundbreaking paper was published: [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). This paper introduced the **Transformer** architecture. This architecture is based on the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism is a way to learn the relationships between the words in a sentence. The transformer architecture is the base for the **BERT**, **GPT-{1:4}**, **Palm**, **LLaMA** models, which are the state-of-the-art model for NLP tasks."
